Steps to make virtual environment

1. Cd into an empty folder
2. Run python3 -m venv yourvenvname (python2 uses virtualenv)
3. Run touch yourPythonFileName.py
4. Open VScode, open the folder containing the virtual environment 
5. Make sure the python interpreter (bottom left) is changed to python 3.x.x (‘yourvenvname’:venv)
6. Use pip install to install your required packages into the folder
7. If wanna export to GitHub run “pip freeze > requirements.txt” this will make a requirement.txt file with all the packages needed. Do not push the yourvenvname into GitHub
